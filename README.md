Passbolt is used by governments, the defence sector, regulated industries and privacy-conscious organizations. Passbolt security model is built on strong foundations:

    End-to-end encryption
    100% open source
    Interoperable crypto
    Granular access rights
    Audited & auditable
    No tracking

Self-hostable server, 
for maximum privacy

If your data are truly yours, you should be able to control where they are located. This is why Passbolt server can be self-hosted inside your own infrastructure: from a raspberry pi inside your office to a High Availability setup hosted at your favorite supplier, you are the one in charge.

Once downloaded and installed, Passbolt server is yours:

    Fully autonomous, no 3rd party service: Passbolt server works as a standalone component. 
    It is fully open source and doesn’t require any third party       
    service to be functional by default. 
    
    Behind your firewall: Passbolt doesn’t require an internet connection access to be functional. 
    It can be completely isolated, protected by your own         
    firewall rules. 
    
    No trackers: We cannot track what Passbolt servers are doing, we don’t know where they are and don’t want to know. 
    Our servers do not send usage data       
    or any form of analytics to us.
